# Visual Bell
# #
# # Any time the BEL code is received, Alacritty "rings" the visual bell. Once
# # rung, the terminal background will be set to white and transition back to the
# # default background color. You can control the rate of this transition by
# # setting the `duration` property (represented in milliseconds). You can also
# # configure the transition function by setting the `animation` property.
# #
# # Values for `animation`:
# #   - Ease
# #   - EaseOut
# #   - EaseOutSine
# #   - EaseOutQuad
# #   - EaseOutCubic
# #   - EaseOutQuart
# #   - EaseOutQuint
# #   - EaseOutExpo
# #   - EaseOutCirc
# #   - Linear
# #
# # Specifying a `duration` of `0` will disable the visual bell.
